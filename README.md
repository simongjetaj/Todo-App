# Todo-App
Todo App with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (mongoose) and jQuery

Assuming, You have node and npm properly installed on your machine, you need to:

1. Download the code
2. Navigate to inside the project folder on terminal, where you would hopefully see a package.json file. :)
3. Do an *npm install* for installing all the project dependencies.
Then *node app.js* to get the app running on local host 
(if you have nodemon installed globally on your computer you can also run nodemon app.js so it restarts Node upon changing a file).
Now, it should be as easy as typing localhost:3000/todo into your favourite web browser.
